- Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate  [(link)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf)

Well known as 'Bahdanau Attention Model', including good introduction and instruction for beginners with historical flow 
and details in neural machine translation. The contribution of this paper is applying alignment model which scores how well the inputs around position j 
and the output at position i match to training each conditional probability p(y|x).
 
Proposed model compresses input sentence more efficient way by considering words matching information compared 
the previous state-of-art model like RNN encoder-decoder which encodes sentence to fixed-length vector. Hence, proposed
model shows better performance at experiments with long sentences.
